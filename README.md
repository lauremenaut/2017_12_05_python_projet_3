This project is part of "DA-Python" path of OpenClassrooms platform : Project_3 : Help MacGyver to escape from the labyrinth !

This is a labyrinth game. MacGyver is trapped in the labyrinth and needs to find and pick up 3 items (a needle, a small plastic tube and ether) to make a syringe. Then, he will be able to neutralize the guard and escape.

Before playing, please follow these few steps :
- clone this repository on your own computer
- download the last version of python 3 for your operating system, see : https://www.python.org/
- create a new virtual environment : "py -3 -m venv env" (for Windows) or "python3 -m venv env" (for other os)
- activate the virtual env : "source env/bin/activate" 
- install the dependancies : "pip install -r requirements.txt"
- execute gamegui.py file : "py -3 gamegui.py labyrinth.json" (for Windows) or "python3 gamegui.py labyrinth.json" (for other os)

The labyrinth layout can easily be modified by editing the "labyrinth.json" file.
